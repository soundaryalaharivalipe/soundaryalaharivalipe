Hey there, I'm Soundarya Lahari! 👋

Welcome to my coding world! 🌍

🎓 I've completed my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida, where I honed my skills in algorithms and web development.

👩‍💻 With a strong foundation in software engineering, I specialize in crafting dynamic and responsive web solutions that enhance user experiences and boost system efficiency.

🛠️ Tools I love: React.js, Node.js, Java, Spring Boot, and a splash of AWS for that cloud goodness!

🌟 Outside the world of code, I'm an explorer at heart – from the mysteries of new technologies to the thrill of new travels, I’m always on the move. I'm an avid reader 📖 and enjoy experimenting in the kitchen 👩‍🍳, finding both activities to be perfect for unwinding and sparking creativity.

🤝 I am passionate about connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts and innovators. Let’s collaborate and build something amazing!✨
